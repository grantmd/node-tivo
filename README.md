Node-Tivo
=========

Node-Tivo is, since I am not very creative at naming things, an implementation of the Tivo protocol in Node.js. It is intended to run on your network to stream media to one or more Tivos.

Instructions
------------
* Install Node.js
* Install node-uuid (`npm install node-uuid`)
* Run `node server.js`
* Visit http://localhost:8080/ to configure
